## My Work

[Mock Food Delivery](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/MockFoodDelivery) - A mock food delivery service. I built this site using just HTML and CSS to practice responsive web design. I utilzed the grid.css framework and various css animations as part of the styling. A gif walk through of the site is available [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/MockFoodDelivery). Feel free to clone the repo and open the index.html file for a hands on view.

[Memory Cards](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/MemoryCards) - Index card web application, deployed on Heroku. The application allows for cloud storage of index cards, simple front end that relies on css animations, login and registration with email verification of registration, cloud storage using PostgreSQL interfaced by SQLAlchemy at the api. (_Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Sendgrid_)

[Forkify](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/Forkify-Production) - Example recipe finder application, check the [repository](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/Forkify-Production) for acceptable search parameters. Deployed on Heroku, served with Flask app. Front end utilizes pagination, asynchronous search request with local cloud storage of favorites (_Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, Flask_)
