## My Work
[Introduction to Environmental GIS](https://www.introtogis.com/) - As an independent study, I developed a web application to assist the incoming students at Southwestern University's Introduction to Environmental GIS. The purpose of this application is to be a resource for students who likely will be taking the class with little in person support as a result of the pandemic. The site is a single page application that is  responsive for mobile and full screen. I developed the api to serve documents to the students and created a simple database to operate as a data repository for the students as well. In addition to developing the web application, I created tutorial videos posted on the app through Youtube and labs that the students will go through during the course of the class. I purchased the domain, hosted the application on Heroku. The average response time is 6 ms, average load time is 1100 ms. ( vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Babel, WebPack )
<br/>
<br/>
[Mock Food Delivery](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/MockFoodDelivery) - A mock food delivery service. I built this site using just HTML and CSS to practice responsive web design. I utilzed the grid.css framework and various css animations as part of the styling. A gif walk through of the site is available [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/MockFoodDelivery) or you can see it for yourself [here](https://silly-swirles-52319c.netlify.app/)
<br/>
[Forkify](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/Forkify-Production) - Example recipe finder application, check the [repository](https://github.com/Daniel-Wh/Forkify-Production) for acceptable search parameters. Deployed on Heroku, served with Flask app. Front end utilizes pagination, asynchronous search request with local cloud storage of favorites (_Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, Flask_)
<br/>
[Static site I made for a photographer](https://www.kcatxphotos.com). This site has a conversion rate of between 5 and 7 percent, utilized design provided by client.
